# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more.

## 📌 What the project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and handling missing values
- Building and evaluating machine learning models
- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

## 🧠 Goal:
To achieve high accuracy in predicting heart disease and understand which features contribute the most to the prediction.

## ✅ Final Result:
- Best accuracy: ~85% using Random Forest and XGBoost

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📁 Files:
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full code
- `data/`: Dataset used (UCI Heart Disease)
- `visuals/`: Plots like feature importance and ROC curve
